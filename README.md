# CardDrawExperiment
I saw a really cool card flip/draw animation in a mobile Solitaire game I played. Spent a handful of hours over Christmas break trying to replicate it. I like the results and this could be a good starting point for future card game projects.   Click the face-down card to draw. The draw destination will cycle through the 4 possible spots.
